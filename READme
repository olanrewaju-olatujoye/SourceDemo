	Also be advise to download the appropriate driver that matches the chrome browser version because this might caused some issues.

### RUNNING PROGRAM ###
* Open the Browser_Operation.cs file in the project
		Right at the Init_Browser() method in below code
		driver = new ChromeDriver(@"C:\Users\Lanre\Downloads\chromedriver_win32 (5)");
		Change the directory to where you install your chrome driver (the same one you saved or remembered)
* Please run the program as TEST and not as a regular program (THIS IS BECAUSE I USED NUNIT framework) and it doesn't have a main method
